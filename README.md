# Simple static API endpoint Express local server

#### Serve static JSON (or any other data of type string) as an API endpoint to fetch data from for development.

'git clone <this repo>'
`npm install`
`npm start test`
A server on 127.0.0.1 port 8080 must have started. 

> Requirements:

    - NodeJs
    - Express
    - nodemon

> Notes:

    - Change the json data in `server.js`
    - Modified accessed control headers to work in development. Never do this in production
